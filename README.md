# -Dark2Light-A-GAN-based-Approach-for-Low-Light-Image-Enhancement
 This repository contains the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for low-light image enhancement. The project aims to improve the quality of low-light images by generating well-lit counterparts using deep learning techniques.
